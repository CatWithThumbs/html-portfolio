<h1>The Best Movies According to Aylynn</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Bubble Boy</h3> 
<p>This is probably the movie that I remember most from my childhood. Fun fact: I had no idea that Jake Gyllenhal played Bubble Boy until like 5 years ago. Wild.</p>
<h3>Matilda</h3>
<p>Matilda is a fantastic movie and I am solemly saddended that I never unlocked my telekinesis powers after watching it. It also inspired my dream to have a beautiful garden; though I don't know how I'll fair with all the bees. Bees and I do not get along....</p>
<h3>The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie</h3>
<p>Spongebob holds a special place in my heart. Though I'll be 26 in two months, I'm still able to quote nearly every episode from memory. It's like I'm a sleeper agent or something.</p>
